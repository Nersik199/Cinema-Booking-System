## Project Overview
The Cinema Booking System allows users to register and book seats for movie showtimes. Admins can add new movies and create showtimes for each movie. It also features a fully functional authentication system, where users can log in and update their profiles.

## Features
### For Users:
- User registration and login
- View available movies and showtimes
- Book seats for a selected showtime
- View booking history
- Profile management (update personal details)

### For Admins:
- Add new movies to the system
- Create showtimes for movies
- View and manage seat reservations

## Technology Stack
**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize (for database interaction)
- MySQL (as the database)

**Frontend:**
- EJS (for rendering views)
- HTML/CSS (for basic styling)
- JavaScript 

**Middleware:**
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Joi for request validation

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cinema-booking-system.git
cd cinema-booking-system
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up the database**
Ensure you have MySQL installed and running on your system. Create a new database and update your `.env` file with your database credentials.

4. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```bash
# Server configuration
PORT=3000

# JWT Secret key
JWT_TOKEN=your_secret_key

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=cinema_db
```



5. **Start the server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Structure

### Seats Table
- `id` (primary key)
- `row` (seat row, e.g., A, B, C)
- `number` (seat number in the row)
- `isAvailable` (boolean indicating seat availability)

### Reservations Table
- `id` (primary key)
- `userId` (foreign key referencing Users table)
- `showtimeId` (foreign key referencing ShowTimes table)
- `seatId` (foreign key referencing Seats table)
